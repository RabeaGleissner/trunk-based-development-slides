            ## Committing to main
            What I learnt from doing trunk based development 🐘

            And how it can help you, too! ✨

            Note: With this talk I'd like to encourage teams to try this practise as well...
            Or at least adopt some of the ways of working that I've learnt from this because I think it's beneficial.

            ## What I'll cover in this presentation

            1. What is trunk based development?
            1. Two stories about my own experience
            1. Reflection time
            1. What practises we can adopt

            ## What is trunk based development?
            - every developer makes small commits to main <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
            - every commit is deployed directly to production <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
            - 🚫 no branches <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

            ## But is your integration really continous if you don't commit to main? 🤯
            ---
            ## Does this not result in chaos?
            - well, sometimes <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
            - you have to learn it <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
            - you have to have the right safety net in place <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

            ➡️ but some of the best practises can help every team <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

            Note: So you might be wondering to yourself... does this trunk based business not result in total chaos?
            You have to follow certain practises in order to do it... and I think those practises are useful for any team, no matter if you're using feature branches or trunk based at scale or you commit to main.

            ## What I'll cover in this presentation

            1. What is trunk based development?
            1. ➡️  ➡️  Two stories about my own experience ⬅️  ⬅️
            1. Reflection on what could have gone better
            1. What practises we can adopt in our"short lived feature branch" environment
            ---
            ## Let me tell you about the time...
            - 👨🏼‍💻 👩🏼‍💻 👩🏻‍💻 <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
            - 🏣 📝 <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
            - medium sized code base (Ruby) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
            - we'd been working with feature branches & PRs <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
            - pair programming most of the time <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
            - very strict TDD <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
            - releases were infrequently done by the client <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
            - no feature flags <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
            - 🙋🏼‍♂️: "Let's commit to main!" <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

            Note: back in the day, Danny, Sarah and I were working on an automated underwriting system for a large insurance company.

            ---
            ## The result
            - a bit of a mess
            - we made huge commits
            - we waited sometimes for days to push to main
            - 🙋🏼‍ would make huge refactorings in the evening
            - git pull always resulted in conflicts
            - it was painful
            ---
            ## Let me tell you about the other time...
            - 👨‍👩‍👦‍👦👪👨‍👨‍👦 
            - 🏡🖥️
            - started a new codebase (React)
            - distributed team Melbourne ↔️ US West coast
            - synchronous overlap: 1 hour a day
            - how else would you work? 🤷🏻‍♂️
            ---
            ## The process 🦘
            - always pair-program
            - strict TDD
            - every commit automatically released to production
            - build notifications in Slack -> if red, fix immediately
            - push small commits continuously
            - run the full build locally before each commit

            Note: we didn't use feature flags
            ---
            ### The other part of the team 🙋🏼‍♂️🙋🏼‍♂️🍔
            - pushed untested code
            - did not pair much
            - code quality lower
            ---
            ## The result
            - trunk based can work!
            - it made us faster
            - everyone felt more ownership over the whole codebase
            - code quality was generally high

            # Reflection time
            ---
            ## Why was my second experience much better than the first?

            Note: Both times we fulfilled the two important pre-requesits, which is having a strong test suite and pair-programming.

            ---
            ### The important difference:

            We didn't wait...

            Note: To be fair, my first experience with TBD was 6 or 7 years ago and I don't remember all the details.
            But back then we didn't manage to make our commits small enough to be able to push them straight away.
            We also didn't pull the code often enough for fear of merge conflicts... "let's finish our code first and then we deal with the merge conflicts". It can't work like that.
            It requires a different way of approaching your coding. 
            ---
            ### How to split your feature into small, stand-alone commits?
            - hide your feature behind a feature flag
            - use the "branch by abstraction technique"
            - use Storybook to build components
            - do any refactoring separately

            Note: You might wonder when to know when to make the commit. General rule: after the red-green-refactor test cycle.
            And never commit when the tests are failing.
            ---
            ### What were the benefits


          

            <!-- code is in a releasable state after each commit -->
            <!-- be in the habit of not breaking things... if the build is red, you have to fix it straight away -->
            <!-- something about raising a PR, request for changes, implementing those, review again... takes time -->
            <!-- reviewing changes is much easier... it's in your IDE -->
            <!-- full commit history is retained -->
            <!-- the process optimises team performance rather than individual performance. why is this good? -->
